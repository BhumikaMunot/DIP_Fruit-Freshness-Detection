# DIP_Fruit-Freshness-Detection
# 🍎 Fruit Freshness Detection using Image Processing and Deep Learning

This project uses **Digital Image Processing (DIP)** techniques and a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to detect the freshness of fruits and vegetables. It supports image inputs from both a dataset and a **live camera feed**, offering real-time predictions about whether a fruit is fresh or rotten.

---

## 📌 Features

- 🔍 Image preprocessing using OpenCV (grayscale, edge detection, histogram equalization, etc.)
- 🧠 CNN model trained on augmented dataset of fresh and rotten fruits
- 🎥 Real-time freshness detection using a live camera
- 📊 Predicts both fruit type and its condition (Fresh/Rotten)
- 🏪 Applications in retail, warehousing, agriculture, and vending systems
